                    What is CSS?
                </header>
                <p>CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users — how they are styled, laid out, etc.
                
                A document is usually a text file structured using a markup language — HTML is the most common markup language, but you
                will also come across other markup languages such as SVG or XML.
                
                Presenting a document to a user means converting it into a usable form for your audience. Browsers, like Firefox, Chrome
                or Internet Explorer, are designed to present documents visually, for example, on a computer screen, projector or
                printer.

                    How does CSS affect HTML?
                </header>
                <p>
                            <p>Web browsers apply CSS rules to a document to affect how they are displayed. A CSS rule is formed from:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>A set of properties, which have values set to update how the HTML content is displayed, for example I want my
                                    element's width to be 50% of its parent element, and its background to be red.</li>
                                <li>A selector, which selects the element(s) you want to apply the updated property values to. For example, I want
                                    to apply my CSS rule to all the paragraphs in my HTML document.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>A set of CSS rules contained within a stylesheet determines how a webpage should look.</p>

                            <h3>A quick CSS example</h3>
                            <p>The above descriptions may or may not have made sense, so let's make sure things are clear by presenting a quick
                                example. First of all, let&#x27;s take a simple HTML document, containing an <b>&#x3C;h1&#x3E;</b> and a
                                <b>&#x3C;p&#x3E;</b> (notice that a stylesheet is applied to the HTML using a <b>&#x3C;link&#x3E;</b>
                                element):</p>
                            <code>&#x3C;<span>!DOCTYPE html</span>&#x3E;
                                <br />&#x3C;<span>html</span>&#x3E;
                                <br />&emsp;&emsp;&#x3C;<span>head</span>&#x3E;
                                <br />&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&#x3C;<span>meta charset=&#x22;utf-8&#x22;</span>&#x3E;
                                <br />&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&#x3C;<span>title</span>&#x3E;My CSS experiment&#x3C;<span>/title</span>&#x3E;
                                <br />&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&#x3C;<span>link rel=&#x22;stylesheet&#x22; href=&#x22;style.css&#x22;</span>&#x3E;
                                <br />&emsp;&emsp;&#x3C;<span>/head</span>&#x3E;
                                <br />&emsp;&emsp;&#x3C;<span>body</span>&#x3E;
                                <br />&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&#x3C;<span>h1</span>&#x3E;Hello World!&#x3C;/<span>h1</span>&#x3E;
                                <br />&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&#x3C;<span>p</span>&#x3E;This is my first CSS example&#x3C;<span>/p</span>&#x3E;
                                <br />&emsp;&emsp;&#x3C;<span>/body</span>&#x3E;
                                <br />&#x3C;<span>/html</span>&#x3E;
                            </code>
                            <p>Now let's look at a very simple CSS example containing two rules:</p>
                            <code><span class="h">h1</span> {
                                <br />&emsp;&emsp;<span>color</span>: blue;
                                <br />&emsp;&emsp;<span>background-color</span>: yellow;
                                <br />&emsp;&emsp;<span>border</span>: 1px solid black;
                                <br />}
                                <br /><span class="h">p</span> {
                                <br />&emsp;&emsp;<span>color</span>: red;
                                <br />}
                                </code>
                            <p>The first rule starts with an <b>h1</b> selector, which means that it will apply its property values to the
                                <b>&#x3C;h1&#x3E;</b> element. It contains three properties and their values (each property/value pair is
                                called a declaration):</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>The first one sets the text color to blue.</li>
                                <li>The second sets the background color to yellow.</li>
                                <li>The third one puts a border around the header that is 1 pixel wide, solid (not dotted, or dashed, etc.), and
                                    colored black.
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>The second rule starts with a <b>p</b> selector, which means that it will apply its property values to the
                                <b>&#x3C;p&#x3E;</b> element. It contains one declaration, which sets the text color to red.</p>

                <p>
                    When a browser displays a document, it must combine the document's content with its style information. It processes the
                    document in two stages:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            The browser converts HTML and CSS into the DOM (Document Object Model). The DOM represents the document in the
                            computer's memory. It combines the document's content with its style.
                        </li>
                        <li>The browser displays the contents of the DOM.</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>

                <p>
                    A DOM has a tree-like structure. Each element, attribute and piece of text in the markup language becomes a DOM node in
                    the tree structure. The nodes are defined by their relationship to other DOM nodes. Some elements are parents of child
                    nodes, and child nodes have siblings.</p>
                    <p>Understanding the DOM helps you design, debug and maintain your CSS because the DOM is where your CSS and the
                        document's content meet up.

                    How to apply your CSS to your HTML
                </header>

                <p>
                There are three different ways to apply CSS to an HTML document that you'll commonly come across, some more useful than
                others. Here we'll briefly review each one.</p>
                <h3>External stylesheet</h3>
                <p>You've already seen external stylesheets in this article, but not by that name. An external stylesheet is when
                    you have your CSS written in a separate file with a ".css" extension, and you reference it from an HTML
                    <b>link</b> element. The HTML file looks something like this:</p>
                <code>&#x3C;!DOCTYPE html&#x3E;
                    <br />&#x3C;<span>html</span>&#x3E;
                    <br />&emsp;&emsp;&#x3C;<span>head</span>&#x3E;
                    <br />&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&#x3C;<span>meta charset=&#x22;utf-8&#x22;</span>&#x3E;
                    <br />&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&#x3C;<span>title</span>&#x3E;My CSS experiment&#x3C;<span>/title</span>&#x3E;
                    <br />&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&#x3C;<span>link rel=&#x22;stylesheet&#x22; href=&#x22;style.css&#x22;</span>&#x3E;
                    <br />&emsp;&emsp;&#x3C;<span>/head</span>&#x3E;
                    <br />&emsp;&emsp;&#x3C;<span>body</span>&#x3E;
                    <br />&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&#x3C;<span>h1</span>&#x3E;Hello World!&#x3C;<span>/h1</span>&#x3E;
                    <br />&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&#x3C;<span>p</span>&#x3E;This is my first CSS example&#x3C;<span>/p</span>&#x3E;
                    <br />&emsp;&emsp;&#x3C;<span>/body</span>&#x3E;
                    <br />&#x3C;<span>/html</span>&#x3E;
                </code>
                <p>And the CSS file:</p>
                <code><span class="h">h1</span> {
                    <br />&emsp;&emsp;<span>color</span>: blue;
                    <br />&emsp;&emsp;<span>background-color</span>: yellow;
                    <br />&emsp;&emsp;<span>border</span>: 1px solid black;
                    <br />}
                    <br /><span class="h">p</span> {
                    <br />&emsp;&emsp;<span>color</span>: red;
                    <br />}
                    </code>
                <p>This method is arguably the best, as you can use one stylesheet to style multiple documents, and would only need to
                    update the CSS in one place if changes were needed.</p>
                <h3>Internal stylesheet</h3>
                <p>An internal stylesheet is where you don't have an external CSS file, but instead place your CSS inside a
                    <b>&#x3C;style&#x3E;</b> element, contained inside the HTML head. So the HTML would look like this:</p>
                <code>&#x3C;<span>!DOCTYPE html</span>&#x3E;
                    <br />&#x3C;<span>html</span>&#x3E;
                    <br />&emsp;&emsp;&#x3C;<span>head</span>&#x3E;
                    <br />&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&#x3C;<span>meta charset=&#x22;utf-8&#x22;</span>&#x3E;
                    <br />&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&#x3C;<span>title</span>&#x3E;My CSS experiment&#x3C;<span>/title</span>&#x3E;
                    <br />&emsp;&emsp;&#x3C;<span>/head</span>&#x3E;
                    <br />&emsp;&emsp;&#x3C;<span>body</span>&#x3E;
                    <br />&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&#x3C;<span>h1 style=&#x22;color: blue;background-color: yellow;border: 1px solid
                        black;&#x22;</span>&#x3E;Hello World!&#x3C;<span>/h1</span>&#x3E;
                    <br />&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&#x3C;<span>p style=&#x22;color:red;&#x22;</span>&#x3E;This is my first CSS
                    example&#x3C;<span>/p</span>&#x3E;
                    <br />&emsp;&emsp;&#x3C;<span>/body</span>&#x3E;
                    <br />&#x3C;<span>/html</span>&#x3E;
                    </code>
                <p>Please don't do this, unless you really have to! It is really bad for maintenance (you might have to update the same
                    information multiple times per document), and it also mixes your presentational CSS information with your HTML
                    structural information, making the CSS harder to read and understand. Keeping your different types of code separated
                    and pure makes for a much easier job for all who work on the code.</p>
